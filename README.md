# How to download

Go to the releases tab, and download the most recent one. You'll be given a folder with everything needed. Create a fabric 1.21.5 instance, and install [Minescript](https://minescript.net/) 5.0 for 1.21.5. Once installed, open up the folder your instances' files are located in, usually ".minecraft", open up the minescript folder and drag all the contents of the folder you downloaded into the minescript folder. Once you've done this, open up minecraft, join a world, and type "\bot" to start the bot. Once the bot is started, it is recommended to look at the wiki/docs for the bot to fully understand its features and to assure you do not break it.
