# How to use

Go to the releases tab, and download the most recent one. You'll be given a folder with everything needed. Create a fabric 1.21.5 instance, and install [Minescript](https://minescript.net/) 5.0 for 1.21.5. Once installed, open up the folder your instances' files are located in, usually ".minecraft", open up the minescript folder and drag all the contents of the folder you downloaded into the minescript folder. Once you've done this, open up minecraft, join a world, and type "\bot" to start the bot. Once the bot is started, it is recommended to look at the wiki/docs for the bot to fully understand its features and to assure you do not break it.  

# Docs/wiki & help

first and foremost, this is a robot controlled by a script, ran by a mod, this is not allowed on many servers and will often result in your bots account (and yours!!) being banned from that server. I, nor the bot are responsible for any moderation action you may face when using the bot.  

**To unlock the full functionality of this bot, please install the following mods for fabric 1.21.5**  

[Chat tools](https://modrinth.com/mod/chat-tools), [ClickCrystals](https://github.com/clickcrystals-development/ClickCrystals), [Cubes Without Borders](https://modrinth.com/mod/cubes-without-borders), [Baritone](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone). Any other mods are up to you, I recommend some performance mods, and dynamicFPS to limit your bots framerate when tabbed out.
